Here is some material we think would be helpful for this week's class.

1. **A Friendly Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks**

A nice video going over a gentle introduction of CNN's and how they work is available on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Ol7ZB0MmU).
2. **Beginner's Guide to Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks**

An easy to understand introduction [here](https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/A-Beginner%27s-Guide-To-Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/).

3. **Understanding Convolutions**
A more math oriented explanation of how convolutions work and why they work can be found [here](http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-Understanding-Convolutions/).
4. **Review Keras for Written Digit Classification**

A notebook going over how to build a model in Keras to recognize hand written digits is [here]().
