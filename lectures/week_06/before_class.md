Here is some material we think would be helpful for this week's class.

1. **Keras Sequential Documentation**

	You can find a helpful guide going over Keras [here](https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide/)

2. **Machine Learning Cheat Sheet**

	You can find a nice cheat sheet going over ML concepts [here](http://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nn_concepts.html)
